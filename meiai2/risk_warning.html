<h1>Important Risk Warning</h1>
<p>Dear User:</p>
<p>Thank you for using the AI stock diagnostic service provided by this platform. Before using, please be sure to read the following risk warnings carefully, fully understand and confirm that you accept the relevant risks.</p>

<div class="warning">
    <h2>I. Limitations of AI Diagnostic Results</h2>
    <p>This is not investment advice; for decision-making reference only.</p>
    <p>The AI stock diagnostic tool on this platform generates analysis results based on public market data (such as stock prices, trading volumes, financial indicators, etc.) and preset algorithm models. Its essence is the output of data statistics and pattern recognition, and does not constitute any direct or indirect investment advice, buy/sell recommendations, or financial operation guidance.</p>
    <p>The model has inherent errors and limitations. The analysis conclusions of the AI model rely on historical data training, but the stock market is affected by multiple complex factors such as macroeconomics, policy changes, industry cycles, corporate governance, etc., and historical performance does not predict future results. The model algorithm may have uncovered risk scenarios or data blind spots, resulting in deviations between the diagnosis results and actual market performance. There is no guarantee of the absolute accuracy or stability of the diagnosis results.</p>
</div>

<div class="warning">
    <h2>II. Risks and Responsibilities That Users Need to Bear on Their Own</h2>
    <p><strong>Independent Judgment and Decision-Making Obligations:</strong> You should analyze and make investment decisions independently based on your own financial situation, risk tolerance, investment goals, and professional financial knowledge.</p>
    <p><strong>Market Risks and Losses Are Borne by Yourself:</strong> Stock investment is highly risky and may result in partial or total loss of principal due to price fluctuations. Any direct or indirect investment losses arising from the use of this tool shall be borne by you.</p>
</div>

<div class="warning">
    <h2>III. Compliance Statement of Data and Information</h2>
    <p><strong>Data Source Description:</strong> The market data used in this tool are all from public channels. The platform has made reasonable efforts to ensure the timeliness and accuracy of the data, but it cannot guarantee that the data is 100% error-free or delayed.</p>
    <p><strong>Scope of Disclaimer:</strong> The platform does not assume any responsibility for the deviation of diagnostic results caused by data source errors or other force majeure.</p>
</div>

<div class="warning">
    <h2>IV. Special Reminder</h2>
    <p>This tool does not involve the interpretation of insider information of listed companies nor does it provide promises such as "stable profit" and "guaranteed return".</p>
    <p>It is prohibited to use this tool for illegal financial activities, and users must comply with the Securities Law and relevant laws and regulations.</p>
    <p>Please be rational about the auxiliary value of AI tools and carefully assess the risks. If you have any questions about stock investment, please consult a licensed financial institution or professional investment advisor.</p>
